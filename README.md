# Fashion-Trend-Using-KMeans
Machine Learning

<h3>Identify fashion trends using K-means algorithm:</h3>

* K-means is an unsupervised machine learning algorithm used for clustering and partitioning data points into groups based on their similarities.
* In our project, we used K-means to group similar images in the MNIST fashion dataset into separate clusters based on their features.
* By applying the K-means algorithm, you aimed to identify common fashion trends that can be used to make better recommendations for shopping.
* However, K-means has some limitations when applied to images, as it treats each pixel independently and doesn't consider spatial information. Therefore, using more advanced techniques such as CNNs can help overcome this limitation.

<h3>Evaluation of different models:</h3>

In our project, we evaluated the performance of different machine learning models such as K-means, random forest, decision tree, and SVM.
To evaluate the performance, you calculated the accuracy of each model on the MNIST fashion dataset.
The accuracy of a model refers to the percentage of correctly classified instances out of the total instances in the dataset.
From your results, SVM had the highest accuracy of 0.91, while K-means had the lowest accuracy of 0.68.
The choice of the model depends on the problem and the dataset. Therefore, it is essential to evaluate the performance of different models before selecting the best one for the task.
Drawbacks of using K-means on images:

K-means is a clustering algorithm that groups data points based on their similarity, but it doesn't consider the spatial relationship between pixels in an image.
This limitation can lead to grouping together visually different images with similar pixel values.
Additionally, the K-means algorithm is sensitive to the initial position of centroids, which can lead to different results each time the algorithm is run.
Therefore, using more advanced techniques such as CNNs can help overcome these limitations and produce more accurate results.
Use of CNNs in identifying fashion trends:

CNNs are a type of neural network commonly used in computer vision tasks, including image classification and object detection.
CNNs use convolutional layers to extract features from images and learn patterns that can be used to classify images accurately.
By using CNNs, you can overcome the limitations of K-means and consider the spatial relationship between pixels in images.
Additionally, CNNs can identify more complex patterns in images and produce more accurate results compared to K-means.
Improving user facility in shopping:

To improve the user's shopping experience, you can implement a recommendation system that suggests products based on the user's browsing and purchase history.
A recommendation system uses collaborative filtering techniques to suggest products that other users with similar interests have purchased.
You can also allow users to filter search results based on their preferences, such as size, color, and style, to help them find the products they want more easily.
Additionally, you can use user feedback to improve the relevance of search results over time by updating the recommendation system's model.
